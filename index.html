                Hello! My name is Zachary Cygan and I have 24 years old studying to be a full stack developer. 
                I currently have a bachelors degree in psychology with a minor in business administration and decided 
                to make a career change to development. I have experience in html, css, and javascript. I have taken
                an interest in coding outside of classes to perfect my skills, but also to create webpages or
                applications that have a use to me or somebody around me. In my free time I like to play video games.
                I usually play World of Warcraft, but I enjoy playing other games like Hallow Knight.
