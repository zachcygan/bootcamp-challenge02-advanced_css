## Description

My motivation for building this portfolio page is to host all my completed projects for employers to view. It was built using HTML for the content and css to style the content. The webpage is simple and features an About me section, followed by the completed projects, and finished by links to contact me or even see what music I am listening too! The header navigation menu will navigate to the given section when clicked.

## Installation

The webpage is available at https://zachcygan.github.io/bootcamp-challenge02-advanced_css/. To view the source code within your browser, press F12 or right click the webpage and select "inspect" on windows. For MacOS,  press Command+Option+I or fn F12 (MacOS) to open Chrome DevTools. You can view any elements on the webpage or any of the styling by selecting the corresponding section in Chrome DevTools. 

Screenshots of the finished webpage are shown below:
